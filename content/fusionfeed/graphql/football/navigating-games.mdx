# Navigating Games

## Schedules

There are two common ways of navigating games. The first is to use the `schedule` API. For example:

```gql v2
{
  nfl {
    schedule(season: 2022, type: REGULAR) {
      games {
        id
        time
        week
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The `schedule` field isn't part of the `FootballOrganization` interface since the arguments differ slightly by league. However, you can still re-use the same fragment for the results like so:

```gql v2
{
  nfl {
    schedule(season: 2022, type: REGULAR) {
      games {
        ...game
      }
    }
  }
  ncaa {
    football(conference: PAC12) {
      schedule(season: 2022, type: REGULAR) {
        games {
          ...game
        }
      }
    }
  }
}

fragment game on FootballGame {
  id
  awayTeamEdge {
    node {
      abbreviation
    }
  }
  homeTeamEdge {
    node {
      abbreviation
    }
  }
}
```

## Search

The other common way of navigating games is via the `gamesConnection` API, which provides powerful search functionality using [FQL](../../fql):

```gql v2
{
  nfl {
    gamesConnection(first: 10, predicate: {
      expression: """SEASON = 2020 and team("ATL") has SCORE > 30"""
    }) {
      edges {
        node {
          id
          time
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Node Lookup

Football games implement the `Node` interface, so games found via the above methods can be looked up directly by id:

```gql v2
{
  node(id: "CA~MjAyMi9SRUcvOC81ODk0OA") {
    ... on NFLGame {
      id
      homeTeamEdge {
        node {
          name
        }
      }
      awayTeamEdge {
        node {
          name
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
