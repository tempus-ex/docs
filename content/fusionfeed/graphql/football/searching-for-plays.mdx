# Searching for Plays

The `playsConnection` API provides powerful search functionality using [FQL](../../fql):

```gql v2
{
  nfl {
    playsConnection(first: 10, predicate: {
      expression: """SEASON = 2020 and team("ATL") has TOUCHDOWN"""
    }) {
      edges {
        node {
          description
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
