# GraphQL

The preferred method of accessing FusionFeed is through its [GraphQL](https://graphql.org) API. GraphQL provides makes it possible to efficiently access all the data you need while minimizing round trips to FusionFeed.

For example, to fetch the 2022 regular season games for the Pac-12 and the abbreviations for their teams, you can use the following query:

```gql v2
{
  ncaa {
    football(conference: PAC12) {
      schedule(season: 2022, type: REGULAR) {
        games {
          id
          week
          awayTeamEdge {
            node {
              abbreviation
            }
          }
          homeTeamEdge {
            node {
              abbreviation
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
