# GraphQL

For most use-cases, we recommend accessing FusionFeed through its [GraphQL](https://graphql.org) API. GraphQL makes it possible to efficiently access all the data you need while minimizing round trips to FusionFeed.

For example, to fetch the 2022 regular season games for the Pac-12 and the abbreviations for their teams, you can use the following query:

```gql v2
query Pac12FootballSchedule {
  ncaa {
    football(conference: PAC12) {
      schedule(season: 2022, type: REGULAR) {
        games {
          id
          week
          awayTeamEdge {
            node {
              abbreviation
            }
          }
          homeTeamEdge {
            node {
              abbreviation
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

While GraphQL is generally recommended, for those that prefer it, a [REST API](/fusionfeed/rest) is also available. Both REST and GraphQL APIs have all of the same data and can be used interchangeably.
