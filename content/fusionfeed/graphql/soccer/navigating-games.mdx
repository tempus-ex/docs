# Navigating Games

The primary means of navigating soccer games is via the top level `soccerMatchesConnection` field, which provides powerful search functionality using [FQL](../../fql):

```gql v2
{
  soccerMatchesConnection(first: 10, predicate: {
    expression: """team("CHE")"""
  }) {
    edges {
      node {
        id
        time
        homeTeamEdge {
          node {
            name
          }
        }
        awayTeamEdge {
          node {
            name
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Soccer matches implement the `Node` interface, so matches found via search can be looked up directly by id:

```gql v2
{
  node(id: "DA~KHc2aBCUu3Kkeeq1cV4EHq") {
    ... on SoccerMatch {
      time
      homeTeamEdge {
        node {
          name
        }
      }
      awayTeamEdge {
        node {
          name
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Matches returned by `soccerMatchesConnection` implement the `SoccerMatch` interface. As a best practice, we highly recommend using `SoccerMatch` in queries like these and avoiding referencing concrete match types such as `EPLMatch`.
