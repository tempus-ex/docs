# REST

For most use-cases, we recommend accessing FusionFeed through its [GraphQL API](/fusionfeed/graphql). GraphQL makes it possible to efficiently access all the data you need while minimizing round trips to FusionFeed.

However, for those that prefer it, REST API endpoints are available. The REST API provides all of the same data as GraphQL and can be used interchangeably.

For example, here's how you might get the last one hundred NFL games available:

```http
GET /v2/nfl/games?last=100
```
