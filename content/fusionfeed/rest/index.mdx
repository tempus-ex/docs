# REST

The preferred way to access the FusionFeed API is through its [GraphQL API](/fusionfeed/graphql).

However, FusionFeed also provides some functionality via REST API. In general, the functionality offered via REST is a subset of the GraphQL API's functionality. However, there are some operations that are only available via REST such as those that return binary data.
