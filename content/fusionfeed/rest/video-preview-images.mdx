# Video Preview Images

Preview images (suitable for thumbnails) can be obtained via the `/v2/av-streams/{streamId}/preview.jpg` endpoint.

If you'd like an image for a particular time, you can specify an RFC-3339 time via the `t` parameter. The preview will be generated from a point in time close to `t`.

Images can be scaled down server-side to a size optimal for thumbnails. To scale the image down, you can specify dimensions via the `fit` or `fill` parameter. For example, `fit=200x200` will cause the returned image to be scaled down until it can fit within a 200 by 200 pixel square.

This endpoint requires authentication, so web apps cannot directly use it in the `src` attribute for an HTML `img` tag. Instead, web apps must fetch the image and use it via [data URI](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/Data_URIs).

For example, this request:

```
GET /v2/av-streams/BA~AnZFw9BpHTRq_J84hAVaVYSx34n8~CCgrzL6_hXIKlr0Bd-2mIURDHfpF/preview.jpg?fit=640x360&t=2023-07-27T00:15:55Z
```
